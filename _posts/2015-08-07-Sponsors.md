# Our Sponsors

Ionide couldn't be created without support of [Lambda Factory](https://lambdafactory.io). If you'd be interested in rich F# test integration check out our VSCode plugin - [Neptune](https://github.com/LambdaFactory/Neptune-public).

If your company would be interested in supporting development of Ionide, or acquiring commercial support sent us email - lambda_factory@outlook.com

You can also support Ionide development on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ionide).
