# Getting Started
On all supported platforms, Windows, Linux and MacOS, the way to begin using F# and Ionide is to install the most recent Long Term Supported version of the .Net Core SDK, install VisualStudio Code and then install the Ionide F# plugin for VisualStudio Code. 

The official step-by-step installation guide for installing F# with Visual Studio Code and Ionide [is here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

Once you have the required components installed the official getting started with F# in Visual Studio Code instructions [are here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-vscode). These will walk you through creating your first F# project and writing F# scripts. 

Once your environment is working you may want to take the [Tour of F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tour).
